If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer: I would query the color matched to the songs and list down the top colors and represent them in an aura

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer: Not all songs might reflect the actual aura of the listener. Hence, I would also see which songs are the most played and get their respective colors, combine them and convert to the actual auras that are true reflections of the listener.
